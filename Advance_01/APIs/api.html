        /* From MDN {
        The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
        A Promise is in one of these states:

        pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
        rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
